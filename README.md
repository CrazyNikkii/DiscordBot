# OSLeaders

OSLeaders is a Discord bot designed to enhance group interactions among friends by integrating Old School RuneScape (OSRS) stats and features into your Discord server. The bot allows users to manage their OSRS accounts, view stats, and access skill-related data directly from the OSRS API. Future updates will include leaderboards and competitive features to make the experience even more engaging.
